The data files contained in this repository are: 

1. full_data.csv: The culmination of all the data processing. Contains album-level aggregations of the Spotify audio features. 
2. spotify_fetch.csv: One row per album, containing the album level data from Spotify. Does not include the audio feature data. 
3. genre_tags.csv: Contains the labels from the Pitchfork data signifying which genres each album belongs to. 

There is one dataset - audio_features.csv - not included on GitHub due to filesize issues. The dataset full_data.csv contains the aggregated information contained in audio_features.csv and so is not necessary for the Jupyter Notebooks or the machine learning code.
