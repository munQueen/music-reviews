# music-reviews
In this capstone project, I have used Spotify's audio feature data to predict Pitchfork review scores and to classify albums by genre. 

The files 'final presentation' contains a brief overview and summary of the project, while 'final report' details the entire process. All project code, data files, and writeups completed along the way can be found in their respective folders. I hope you find my work interesting, and please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions.
